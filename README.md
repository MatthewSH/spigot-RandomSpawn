# Random Spawn
## About
#### Current Version 1.0.0
Teleport someone to a random spawn point in the world. Great for anarchy servers.

## Installation
Just downloaded the JAR from the releases tab and drop it into your `plugins` folder and start the server, edit `config.yml`, reload, enjoy.

## Configuration
### Coordinates (`coords`)
Each coordinate (x and z) have a min and max option. This gives you the ability to choose a range for people to spawn in so you don't have to sacrifice storage or RAM usage when using this plugin.

### First Join (`on-first-join`)
This takes someone to a random spawn on the first time they join.

### On Join (`onjoin`)
Every time someone joins, they get taken to a random spawn.

### On Respawn (`onrespawn`)
Every time someone respawns they get taken to a random point.

### Signs (`signs`)
Allows the use of the random spawn signs. When creating a sign on the first line type  `randomspawn` and the sign will change to a Random Spawn sign with your text (`line-1`, `line-2`, `line-3`) on it.

### Debugging (`debugging`)
If you're having issues, you can turn on `debug` and it can log out a bit more information.
